Doxygen
===============

Almost the same as the original Doxygen, except an added new, strong string type: the URL (URI) string representation.

Every string that contains an URL, its type is changed to a specific URL string type. It verificates the URL-s format and splits into URL parts (like host, path etc.) if it has a valid format.

Contains no extra added functionality.
